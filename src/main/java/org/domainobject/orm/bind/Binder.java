/**
 * <p>
 * A {@code Binder} is responsible for transferring data between a field and a
 * column. When a value is transferred from a {@link ResultSet} to an object
 * it's called <i>receiving</i>; when a value is transferred from an object to a
 * {@link PreparedStatement} it's called sending. A binder may do nothing but
 * copy data to or from the object, but it may also may also transform the data.
 * The binder to be used for each of an object's persistent fields is determined
 * when that object's metadata object is assembled (See
 * {@link MetaDataConfigurator#setBinder(Class, Binder)}). You can influence
 * this process in various ways. By default binders are sourced from the
 * {@link StandardBinderRepository}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In general, binders are there for the following reasons:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * In cases where JDBC's type mapping system does not work. For example, you
 * cannot simply set a {@code StringBuilder} field using
 * {@code ResultSet#getString(int) ResultSet.getString}:
 * {@code StringBuilder sb = rs.getString(1)} will not work!</li>
 * <li>
 * To let you bind common types (like int) in alternative (and possibly
 * uncommon) ways.</li>
 * <li>
 * To let you persist uncommon types (like {@link java.io.File} or your own
 * classes) to the database in a way that makes sense for your application.</li>
 * <li>
 * To ensure consistency across RDBMSes and JDBC implementations when converting
 * between common types. For example, by using the {@link StringyBinder}, you
 * can be assured that when a String must be converted to a boolean, or vice
 * versa, "true", "on", "1", "y" and "yes" will count as true and the rest as
 * false, whichever JDBC implementation you use.</li>
 * </ol>
